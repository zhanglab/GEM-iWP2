Analysis and Simulation Scripts
Each subfolder in the scripts/ directory contains pre-generated data files, and
the associated scripts needed to generate data summaries and figures.

pipeline/WP2-modeling.md
- Markdown file providing instructions on how to run all modeling scripts used
for simulation and analysis.

scripts/TMFA-Results/*
- Raw and summarized TMFA simulation data.

scripts/ATPM/*
- Scripts and data associated with ATP maintenance calculations.

scripts/efficiency/*
- Scripts associated with calculating metabolic efficiency metrics.

scripts/analysis/*
- Scripts associated with analysis of fluxes, deltaG values, concentrations, and
gene expression values.
